# Defuddle — Fetch URL as Raw Markdown

Fetch $ARGUMENTS as clean markdown using defuddle.md.

## How defuddle works

Prepend `https://defuddle.md/` to the URL path (strip the `https://` from the original URL):

- `https://example.com/some/page/` → `https://defuddle.md/example.com/some/page/`

## Steps

1. Parse the URL from $ARGUMENTS to build the defuddle URL
2. Determine the output filename from the URL path (last meaningful path segment + `.md`)
3. If a `ref-sources/` directory exists in the project, save there by default; otherwise save in the current directory
4. Fetch and save:

```bash
curl -s "https://defuddle.md/{url-without-https://}" > {output-path}
```

5. Confirm the file was written and show the first few lines

## API key (paid tier)

Paid tiers use an API key. If the user mentions having one, tell them to check defuddle.md/docs for the exact header format, then use:

```bash
curl -s -H "<auth-header-from-docs>" "https://defuddle.md/{url}" > {output-path}
```

Otherwise use the unauthenticated form (free tier: 1,000 requests/month per IP).

## Notes

- Works for HTML pages. Does not work for PDFs — note this to the user and skip.
- Free tier is limited to 1,000 requests/month per IP. Paid tiers use an API key; see defuddle.md/terms.
- If the user provides multiple URLs, fetch them all in parallel using a single Bash command with `&` and `wait`, or sequentially with `&&`.
- Do not use WebFetch — it summarizes content through an AI model and loses detail. Always use `curl` directly.
- The saved file will contain defuddle's YAML frontmatter (title, source, language, word_count) followed by the verbatim page content as markdown.
